# ALA 470: Data Visualization
Data visualization is increasingly used to understand the world around us; from the increasing presence of the ‘Digital Humanities’ to representations of complex social systems to diagrams meant to persuade us visual representations of data are ascendant. Visualization mediates our relationship to diverse types of data and also provides a powerful tool for exploring and explaining our own research data. This seminar will explore data visualization as a technical skill and as a cultural phenomenon. We will aim both to understand how to create visualizations and critically understand what they do in society.

# Dataset
Turn in the dataset you plan to use for your final project. You can either upload it on canvas (link or actual file) or you can email it to me. You can change your dataset over the course of the semester, I just want a sense of what you plan to work with and for you to have something to use for the labs if appropriate. Some places you may consider looking for data are:
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Data.gov](data.gov)
- [This library guide for statistics and datasets](https://guides.lib.umich.edu/govstatistics)
- [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/)

Another good place to look is at whatever government agency has oversight of whatever topic you are interested in. If you have an idea but cannot find the dataset, I can help; just send me an email.

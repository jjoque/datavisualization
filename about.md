# Overview
### Winter 2024: Data Visualization – ALA 470

Justin Joque (office hours available M-F 9-5 by request)
joque@umich.edu

Data visualization is increasingly used to understand the world around us; from the increasing presence of the ‘Digital Humanities’ to representations of complex social systems to diagrams meant to persuade us visual representations of data are ascendant. Visualization mediates our relationship to diverse types of data and also provides a powerful tool for exploring and explaining our own research data. This seminar will explore data visualization as a technical skill and as a cultural phenomenon. We will aim both to understand how to create visualizations and critically understand what they do in society.

### Pandemic Accommodations

As we enter another pandemic semester, I recognize that this all continues to be a huge challenge. I am more than happy to make accommodations and adjustments but I need to know from you how to do so. If you are having any challenges with the course or anything else please let me know as soon as possible and we can figure out how to best handle it together.

***If you are feeling sick, please do not come to class. You do not need a doctors note or any proof, I trust you. Just let me know as soon as you are able and we will make alternative arrangements to get you caught up***

### Resources

I have created a page to save resources that you might find helpful throughout the semester.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain proficiency in the technical and aesthetic production of data visualizations. Learn to use tools such as R, Python, Cytoscape, etc. in ways that accurately, meaningfully and convincingly depict diverse types of data.
- Understand the history of data visualization and how it functions as a historically and culturally situated phenomena.
- Be able to interrogate and express the assumptions and message of a given data visualization

### A Note on Method

Like other technical modes of representation, whether poetry or cinema, there is immense value in understanding both how to produce and critique these technologies and techniques. It is challenging to understand what a tool is and how to use it at the same time. Do we risk in creating data visualizations foreclosing our ability to understand how they function as objects in society? Conversely, in examining data visualization as a cultural object do we cut ourselves off from knowledge of the craft itself?

This seminar will alternate between these two modes of knowing and learning with the hope of ultimately understanding data visualization as both tool and phenomenon. To do so, we will combine traditional seminar discussion and hands on labs. You will be responsible for producing written analyzes and your own data visualizations. We will learn how to use data visualization in research and also analyze data visualization as a cultural, mediatic and technological activity.

### Course Policies

*Attendance*: I request you come to class as much as you are able to. Participation forms a significant portion of your grade, but participation will be understood very broadly so we can figure out ways for you to participate around any necessary absences. An unexcused absence results in a zero for participation on a given day. If you must miss class and are able to, please speak to me in advance as soon as you can (of course if you get sick immediately before class you cannot, but please let me know as soon as you are able).

*Lateness*: Don’t be late to class.

*Late assignments*: Your assignments will be submitted online, through the Assignments module of this course’s canvas site. Assignments submitted after the deadline, except in extenuating circumstances, will receive a lower grade.

*Plagiarism*: The College of LS&A and the University have strict policies against plagiarism. It is not acceptable to knowingly or unknowingly submit someone else’s ideas, words, or work as your own. Any act of academic dishonesty, either through plagiarizing someone else’s work or by allowing your own work to be misused, will cause you to fail the assignment and possibly the course. I will report any such incidents to the college.

### Getting Extra Help

I will be glad to help you any way I can through this course. Please let me know if there are any accommodations I can provide that will help you in engaging with the class; I will make every effort in my power to help. I encourage any of you who would like to discuss individual learning strategies to talk to me outside of class. Our conversations will of course be confidential.

The university has extensive resources set up to help students in a variety of situations, including the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (G-664 Haven Hall, ssdoffice@umich.edu) and the Adaptive Technology Computing Site (Shapiro Undergraduate Library, Room 1128, sites.atcs@umich.edu).

### Assignments (85% of final grade):

- Twice during the semester you will be responsible for brining a visualization to class (5% each) and leading a short discussion about its data source(s); aesthetic choices; technical process; communicative power; etc. You can use this sheet to signupLinks to an external site..
- A midterm paper (20%) that will critically engage a data visualization or visualization technique, exploring both its technical methods and cultural impact. You will be graded on your ability to use critical approaches to data visualization to interrogate the larger cultural, political, social and aesthetic implications of a data visualization or technique of your choosing. You will be expected to historically and socially contextualize the visualization, the data it uses and the techniques it uses based on both our course readings and your own research.
- ‘Lab’ assignments (20% total) from each of the technical classes. You will be graded on your ability to think critically about the data and how best to represent it visually. You will be expected to learn the technical skills, but the assignments focus will be on your effective and thoughtful use of these skills rather than the skills themselves. These will be designed such that you should be able to finish them in class as part of the lab session.
- A final visualization project (25%) using data from your own research or area of study. You will be required to think critically about the data you choose and be able justify the way you represent the data. Early in the semester you will be required to turn in your proposed dataset (5%)
- A short essay (5%) describing and critically reflecting on your final visualization project

### Participation (15%):

- You are expected to attend class barring sickness or other obligations.
- Consistent lateness will also impact your participation grade.
- There are a number of ways that you can participate in this course; if you are at all concerned about your participation grade, please contact me and we can discuss ways to make sure you get full credit for participating.

# ALA 470: Data Visualization

Data visualization is increasingly used to understand the world around us; from the increasing presence of the ‘Digital Humanities’ to representations of complex social systems to diagrams meant to persuade us visual representations of data are ascendant. Visualization mediates our relationship to diverse types of data and also provides a powerful tool for exploring and explaining our own research data. This seminar will explore data visualization as a technical skill and as a cultural phenomenon. We will aim both to understand how to create visualizations and critically understand what they do in society.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain proficiency in the technical and aesthetic production of data visualizations. Learn to use tools such as R, Python, Cytoscape, etc. in ways that accurately, meaningfully and convincingly depict diverse types of data.
- Understand the history of data visualization and how it functions as a historically and culturally situated phenomena.
- Be able to interrogate and express the assumptions and message of a given data visualization

## A Note on Method

Like other technical modes of representation, whether poetry or cinema, there is immense value in understanding both how to produce and critique these technologies and techniques. It is challenging to understand what a tool is and how to use it at the same time. Do we risk in creating data visualizations foreclosing our ability to understand how they function as objects in society? Conversely, in examining data visualization as a cultural object do we cut ourselves off from knowledge of the craft itself?

This seminar will alternate between these two modes of knowing and learning with the hope of ultimately understanding data visualization as both tool and phenomenon. To do so, we will combine traditional seminar discussion and hands on labs. You will be responsible for producing written analyzes and your own data visualizations. We will learn how to use data visualization in research and also analyze data visualization as a cultural, mediatic and technological activity.

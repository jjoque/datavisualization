# Lab 1 - Drawing
While drawing a graph may seem like an overly simple place to start, it allows us to begin from the essence of data visualization--that is taking information and mapping it to the visual plane. While computers and code can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process, beginning with drawing allows us to sidestep any technical difficulties that may arise and focus exclusively on our data, design, layout, communication, etc.

For this lab you will spend a few days prior (about a week or so) gathering some kind of data about your own life: the number of coffees you drink; hours watching streaming; texts to friends; emails answered, etc. The easiest way to make an interesting graph is to start with interesting data. It does not need to be too complex but adding some additional variables or categories will make this much easier. So, not just how many coffees but the types; or where you bought them; or who you drank them with, etc. You do not need (or probably want to) document every single detail but one or two additional elements will suffice.

I will distribute graph paper and bring colored pencils and markers to class for the lab; so just bring your data and there will be time to draw and share the graph you make. The graph can be any type but should show the data in a clear and understandable way. Make sure to include a title, axes, legend, etc. as appropriate.

# Lab 1 - Drawing
While drawing a graph may seem like an overly simple place to start, it allows us to begin from the essence of data visualization--that is taking information and mapping it to the visual plane. While computers and code can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of this process, beginning with drawing allows us to sidestep any techincal difficulties that may arise and focuse exclusively on our data, design, layout, communication, etc.

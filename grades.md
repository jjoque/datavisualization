# Grading
## Assignments (85% of final grade):

- Twice during the semester you will be responsible for brining a visualization to class (5% each) and leading a short discussion about its data source(s); aesthetic choices; technical process; communicative power; etc. You can use this sheet to signupLinks to an external site..
- A midterm paper (20%) that will critically engage a data visualization or visualization technique, exploring both its technical methods and cultural impact. You will be graded on your ability to use critical approaches to data visualization to interrogate the larger cultural, political, social and aesthetic implications of a data visualization or technique of your choosing. You will be expected to historically and socially contextualize the visualization, the data it uses and the techniques it uses based on both our course readings and your own research.
- ‘Lab’ assignments (20% total) from each of the technical classes. You will be graded on your ability to think critically about the data and how best to represent it visually. You will be expected to learn the technical skills, but the assignments focus will be on your effective and thoughtful use of these skills rather than the skills themselves. These will be designed such that you should be able to finish them in class as part of the lab session.
- A final visualization project (25%) using data from your own research or area of study. You will be required to think critically about the data you choose and be able justify the way you represent the data. Early in the semester you will be required to turn in your proposed dataset (5%)
- A short essay (5%) describing and critically reflecting on your final visualization project
